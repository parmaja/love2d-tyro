# BASIC

Small Lua lib to add more simple functions make it more easy for kids

 * input()  Wrap to io.read but it detect if the string is number it will convert the result to number

 * write(...) Wrap to io.write nothing else

 * writeln(...)

# TODO

functions is easy, but drawing is my problem, i want to add circle, rectanlge, line, pixel etc, that need GUI window, but i am thinking about Love game engine, to add more animations too, like speriates

for example from my mind

    sperite = sperites.new
    sperite.load('sperite.png')
    sperite.move(x, y)

also like to make shapes as sperite

    circle = circle.new
    circle.move(x, x)
    circle.show
    ...
    circle.hide

I still work on it, do not use it.
