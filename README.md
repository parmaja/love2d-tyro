# Lua LÃ–VE BASIC

Small Lua and Love2D module to add more simple functions make it easy for kids and beginners.

 * input()  Wrap to io.read but it detect if the string is number it will convert the result to number
 * write(...) Wrap to io.write nothing else
 * writeln(...)
 * int alias of math.floor(x)

Functions
 
 * pause(1) --one second
 * canvas.lock()
 * canvas.unlock()
 * canvas.freeze(0.1)
 * canvas.defreeze()
 * canvas.clear()
 * canvas.color(colors.Red)
 * canvas.backcolor(colors.Red)
 * canvas.rectangle(x, y, w, h)
 * canvas.circle(x, y, r)
 * canvas.text(text, x, y)

Object Example 

    circle = circle.new
    circle.move(x, x)
    circle:show()
    circle:hide()
 
# TODO

functions is easy, but drawing is my problem, i want to add circle, rectanlge, line, pixel etc, that need GUI window, but i am thinking about Love game engine, to add more animations too, like speriates

For example from my mind

    sperite = object.sperite("sperite.png")
    sperite:move(x, y)

I still work on it, do not use it.

# How to use it
